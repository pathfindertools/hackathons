**Photo Cards**

Click on a section to edit it's content.

## Styling Sections
All sections have a "Section Style" button and some also have a "Card Style" button. Dive into these menus to choose section colors, backgrounds, layouts and type settings.

## Navigation
A navigation bar can be drawn across the top of the page. Settings for this are available from the navigation button on the main page sidebar. Navigation is comprised of two types of links.

**Anchor Jumps**  
Sections that have a navigation label will have that label drawn in the top nav. Clicking that item will scroll down to the section.

**Additional Links**  
Links to external pages can be added from the navigation menu.

## Meta Data
The main page sidebar contains a Meta button which brings you to the Meta sidebar. This information is used for the site title and description as well as open graph for social sharing.
